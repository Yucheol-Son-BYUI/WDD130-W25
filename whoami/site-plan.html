      The articles in the Project Section will be dynamically added by fetching them from my GitHub page. Initially, only 2â€“3 articles will be displayed, and additional articles will appear when the user clicks the "More" button.
      The Career section is not planned to be dynamic, but if such information can be obtained from sites like LinkedIn, the Career section will also fetch data from there.

      The Calendar displays a calendar based on today's date. When the user clicks on a specific date, the available times for that date are updated in a select dropdown. After selecting a time and clicking the button, an email is automatically generated in a specific format using the &lt;a href="mailto:"&gt; feature.
